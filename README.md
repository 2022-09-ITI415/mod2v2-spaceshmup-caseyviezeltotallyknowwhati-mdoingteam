What I want to do for space shooter

No automatic shield, make it a pickup-able item
Implement a dodge roll in 8 cardinal directions. Cant shoot while dodge rolling. Triggers on either space bar or right click. Either make it be a full roll or a teleport effect.
Maybe implement a super move. It’ll probably be a big laser. Possibly homing rockets. Has a charge bar
Maybe can have pet powerups with little floating dudes surrounding the player in an orbit. Shoot on a timer, not when the player shoots. For difficulty’s sake maybe don’t have the pets take damage for you
Maybe have a level system where every level increases the spawn rate by X% or something. Transition between levels by having ship automatically path and pull into a star base or something. At star bases maybe offer players a selection of powerups/pets able to be purchased based on the points gained by killing enemies.

Base level game nothing changed yet
Implemented a blink mechanic. Made ship travel to distance X units away based on last input direction from arrow keys. Triggered by right mouse click. Adjustable in unity
Added color to enemy ships (green for core, silver for exterior, red for extra things)
Added color to hero ship (light blue for core, blue for exterior, red for extra things)
Set damage to 2 and shoot speed to 69 because nice 
Tried to implement a level progression system where counts number of enemies and when count reaches a certain number it resets the level and is means to say like “level up! moving onto stage X!”
